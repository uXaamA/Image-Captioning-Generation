# Image-Captioning-Generation
This project implements an Image Captioning Generation System using the Flickr8K dataset. The model leverages a CNN (ResNet-50) for image encoding and an LSTM network (with attention) for decoding into natural language descriptions.  This focused on learning and building multi-modal deep learning systems that combine vision and language.
